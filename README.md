# Machine Learning for Bukkit Plugins
![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/LATEST_UPDATE-2023--04--06-red.svg)

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of dummy plugins that demonstrate how developers could implement machine learning in their plugins. While these plugins 
are not ment to be used by server owners, they were made to show how developers could implement machine learning into their project. Exploring these sample
plugins are a good start if you're a plugin developer trying to implement machine learning into their projects, or if you're someone who wants to learn more about
the technology behind AI.

## Contents
This repository, as time goes on, will contain machine learning techniques like these in plugins:
  * Classification
  * Regression
  * Neural Networks
  * And more
  
Each plugin includes a brief explanation of the method employed and how it might be utilized in the Minecraft world. The code also has thorough documentation
that includes explanations of how the machine learning models operate. To understand more about machine learning and how it may be applied in Minecraft plugins
, feel free to browse the repository and investigate the different plugins. 

## Resources
1. [Implementing Machine Learning in Your Plugins: An Introduction](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/implementing-machine-learning-in-your-plugins-an-introduction.599387/) 
-The use of machine learning in Minecraft plugins is explained in this post on the SpigotMC forums. If you're unfamiliar with the subject and want to learn more
, this is an excellent place to start.

  
## Updates
This repository will be updated as much as possible when a new resource thread is released on SpigotMC, while contributions or pull requests of some sort are
